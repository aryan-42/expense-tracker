# expense-tracker
In this project, I created a console-based spent tracker application using the core Java, where users can add, can see and classify them and generate monthly reports. This allowed me to implement major programming concepts such as object-oriented designs, data structures and user input handling.

I used a modular structure with three sections: the main for execution, expenditure for data representation, and the expansion for all main functionality. Expenditure enaches details such as class details, amounts, category and date. In the expansion, I implemented a menu-operated system using loops and conditional to navigate options.

To store and manage expenses, I used arraylist, and for the category group, I applied the hashmap. To handle the dates, I used localdate and datetimeformatter, making sure that all inputs follow the correct format. I included strong input verification using a tri-catch block to handle incorrect or unexpected inputs, such as non-selection values ​​or invalid dates, which made the program stronger.

The monthly report facility was an important part of the project. This requires filtering expenses according to month and year, calculating yogas, and a category-wise breakdown with percentage contribution. This improved my logical thinking and increased my understanding of collection manipulation.

During development, I focused on clean codes, reusable and user -friendly interactions. The project helped me practically implement Java concepts such as encapsulation, collection, exception handling and modular coding. It was a great learning experience and assured me in building the real world Java applications.
